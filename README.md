# Ditch Class Enhanced

* 🖌️🎓🎨 Regular Ditch Class but enhanced, including an integrated emulator, more games, improved app list, and a browser. 🖌️🎓🎨
* The website is best viewed at a Chromebook's native resolution (below 1080p). 
* This repository is made to be forked and the Vercel link is just to showcase the site.

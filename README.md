> You currently cannot deploy Art Class to a static host, such as Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or GitHub Pages. This feature is planned in a future update. Vercel does work - however, don't expect verification to work.

## Adding Retro Games
Use the example provided in public/assets/data/retros.js

## Hosting Your Retro Games Server
It's best to create a seperate directory and locally host your games server there (Instructions Below) and port foward it to your IP Address. Also use FreeDNS to hide your IP Address. It's best to use port 80 for Let's Encrypt verification.

## Run locally

You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) installed on your system.

````bash
git clone https://github.com/havi11/artclass-enhanced.git # Clone the repo
